#Running Grafana
You may either run Grafana in docker as detailed in run_grafana.sh or you may install and run a Grafana daemon locally on the machine that will run Grafana, usually the same machine that you will be running a browser on. However, you may also run Grafana somewhere else and connect using a tunnel. If you use the run_grafana.sh script, Grafana data will be saved to the directory grafana_data.
